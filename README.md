# vba-challenge

This repo contains VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. Using a spreadsheet with mult-year data (with each year in separate sheets), for each year of data, the script returns a summary of:

- ticker symbol
- yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year (conditionally formmated to highlight positive and negative change)
- the percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
- the total stock volume of the stock

The script also returns the stock with the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and greatest total volume.

The results of running the scipt is saved as screenshots.
